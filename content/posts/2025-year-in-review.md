2025 was the most intense year of my life.

The good:

- 💜 Exited my first company Senja, after hitting $850K ARR
- 🌿 Founded my second company [Ferndesk](https://ferndesk.com)
- 💸 Grown to ~$15K ARR so far
- 🚢 1.5K commits, 16 major releases
- 🇪🇺 Visited the EU for the first time!

The bad:

- ⏎ Pivoted the company a few months back
- 🦥 Completely stopped exercising
- 🖌️ Paused most hobbies outside work
- 😵‍💫 Learned how difficult building a startup solo is!
- 🤢 Frequent health issues later on in the year + ongoing struggles with an injured knee

My greatest takeaway this year is that I have nobody to blame for my unhappiness and discontent but myself.

I used to blame other people for a lot of my problems.

But over the last 5 or so months, I've enjoyed a really privileged position where I answer largely to no-one, and I have the freedom to do whatever I want.

Seeing that I'm still struggling with the same problems made me realize that "it's all on me."

That realization has helped me take control and start working through them.

In 2026, I'm going all in on Ferndesk and doubling down on the things that work.

I'm still chasing my original goal, $100K MRR, bootstrapped.

It's taken a ridiculous amount of work to get 10% of the way, and scaling will be even harder.

But I'm obsessed with building one of the best products in this space, and I won't back down until I get there.
