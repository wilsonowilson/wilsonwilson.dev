# Building Senja to $800K ARR

Senja is a testimonial collection tool that makes collecting, managing and sharing testimonials easy. Here's the story of how we built it.

## The Beginning

My cofounder Olly and I started Senja with a simple observation: collecting testimonials was painful for most businesses.

## What We Learned

1. **Focus on the core problem** - Don't get distracted by shiny features
2. **Talk to customers daily** - They know what they need
3. **Ship fast, iterate faster** - Perfect is the enemy of good

## What's Next

We're continuing to build and improve Senja. The journey continues!
