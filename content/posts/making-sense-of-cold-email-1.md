Today marks the end of the third month since I started Indie-Hacking in public. It's been a wild ride, and I've had so much fun.

I've built two products in the last three months, [Senja](https://senja.io) and [Bungee](https://bungee.so). Until recently, I hadn't taken working on my projects very seriously, and making them was something I did for fun, not for profit.

But now that I spend an ungodly amount of time working on the two of them, I've decided that I might as well take working on them as seriously as possible.

---

Two days ago, I forcefully ripped the developer out of me and shifted my gears towards marketing (I'm sure [Dagobert Renouf](https://twitter.com/dagorenouf) would be proud 😂). My goal is to get my first paying user for Senja before I even touch my code again.

The problem is, **I don't know jack shit about marketing**.

I'm a developer **to the bone**. I've spent the last three years working full and part-time as a software engineer at multiple companies and building things I'm interested in.

So in my first article series called Making Sense of Marketing (or MSM for short), I'll talk about my journey from a complete dummy to _hopefully_ a pro at marketing.

I've decided to focus on three different marketing channels:

1. Cold outreach (Cold Emailing and DMs)
2. SEO and Content Marketing (long term)

3. Building in public and having fun on Twitter (Yes, this works)

Unlike #1, I have some experience with #2. I've written multiple blogs that have gotten a steady flow of organic traffic from Google, and I know how to market my content on platforms like Reddit and Pinterest.

That's precisely why I'm finding cold outreach incredibly interesting.

At the moment, I'm only focusing on cold emails and cold DMs on Reddit, two things I am very unfamiliar with.

I'll talk about how I'm using Reddit DMs to get leads some other time, but so far, it's been _very_ interesting, to say the least, 👀

## Taking the first step

Yesterday I sent my very first cold email 🥳

In retrospect, I did it erratically and without much thought. As I write this sentence, I realize I've forgotten who I sent it to and what I wrote about :P

But the first step is the most important after all.

I found someone on Twitter who had shared a testimonial from one of their customers, then I collected their email from their website and sent them this email (private details blurred out).

I have no idea if my email was good or not (if you've got comments, hit me up on Twitter 😋). No matter the case, I haven't gotten a response yet.

Sending this showed me just how little I know about cold email, and I decided that I'd do things differently from the next day.

## What I'm doing now

Today (2022-04-01), I spent a good deal of time doing research about cold email. From the little I've learned, I understand that the cold email process can be broken down into three or more stages:

- Lead prospecting
- First contact
- Following up if there's no response

So I'll be going through this process in that order.
