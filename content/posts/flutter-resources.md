description: If you need to sharpen your Flutter Skills, read this article and get a list of over 200 Categorized Flutter resources to advance your learning.
---

The number of people who have asked me to share Flutter Resources they can use to learn development has been insane! And since I started my [Flutter blog](http://wilsonwilson.dev), the number has grown exponentially.

I hate giving half-hearted responses, so I decided to create a _massive_ and organized list of resources to help aspiring developers grow and stay organized. This list contains articles, YouTube videos, courses (non-affiliate), and even GitHub repositories that will help you kick off your Flutter development.

Although this list can be used as a roadmap, I don’t recommend it, reason being that a lot of the topics mentioned are not necessary for professional Flutter development.

For example, you don’t need to learn about _every_ state management solution. Just picking one or two from this list will be good enough to understand the fundamentals.

One more side note. This list is not rigid, meaning that it will be updated from time to time.

Happy Fluttering 🚀

## State Management

State management can be very confusing to new Flutter Developers, the reason being that there are _so many options._

But you do not need to know how to use every state management solution to be considered a good Flutter Developer.

Just knowing how to manage state using one or two packages and of course, the default state management solution in Flutter should be enough. The following Flutter resources (sorted by package/method) will help you learn the basics of using each solution.
