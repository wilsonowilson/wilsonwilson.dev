title: 'Stop building every feature request'
description: For the first 6 months of my Indie Hacking journey, I had built every single feature request my users asked for. Now I'm democratizing feedback collection. Here's why.

When I first started receiving feature requests, I would get started on them immediately and release them in a matter of hours to make my users happy.

The problem was that I started building a product that had no real focus.

To make matters worse, users would make feature requests that conflicted with each other. What do you do in a situation like that?

To regain control, and to build a product that my ideal users would love, I started democratizing feedback collection

> I'm using canny.io for this, but there are many feedback tools I know of, like upvoty.com and hellonext.co. I chose Canny because it's completely free to get started with 😅

I added the link to the feedback page to my site's menu, and feedback from genuinely interested users has slowly been rolling in.

Also, when people ask me for a new feature in support, I just ask them to create a feature request so that other users can vote on it.

Doing this has made knowing what to build next way easier, and now I'm building a product that my users actually need.
